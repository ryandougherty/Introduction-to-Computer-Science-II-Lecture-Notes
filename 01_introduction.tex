Welcome to these lecture notes for CSE205! This guide will follow up on the first lecture notes (for CSE110), and get more into the ``algorithms and computation" side of programming. However, all examples will be in Java, to remain consistent between the two sets of notes. As we have said before, programming is becoming more of an important tool in the last few decades. Understanding of these technological shifts, therefore, is imperative. 
\\ \\
The topics are split up according to the Table of Contents above, and their corresponding page numbers. At the end of each chapter are written and programming exercises. The written exercises are for testing your knowledge of the material, and the programming ones are to see if you can write programs using the material from that chapter.
